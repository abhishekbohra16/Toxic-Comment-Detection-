# Toxic Comment Classification (NLP Project)

This is an ongoing project where I am working on detecting toxic comments using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
The focus of the current stage is **data preprocessing** — cleaning and preparing text data so it can be used for machine learning models later.

## 📝 Current Progress (Phase 1: Preprocessing)

✅ Loaded dataset  
✅ Removed punctuation & special characters  
✅ Lowercased text  
✅ Removed stopwords  
✅ Tokenized text  
✅ Basic text normalization  

🚧 Next steps (not completed yet):
- Vectorization (TF-IDF / Word Embeddings)
- Model training (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Evaluation (accuracy, F1-score, etc.)
- Optional: Build a small web app for prediction

## 📊 Dataset Used

Source: Kaggle – Toxic Comment Classification Challenge  
Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge

The dataset contains user comments labeled as **toxic, insulting, obscene, threat, identity hate,** etc.

## 🛠️ Tech / Libraries Used So Far

- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

*(More ML libraries will be added in the next phase)*

## 🎯 Goal of the Project

To build a machine-learning model that can automatically detect whether a given text contains toxic, abusive, or offensive language.
